    <h2 class="story-title">Mission</h2>

The mission describes the Archive’s main purpose:
The Archive inspires a diverse audience with the enduring life and dedication innate to indigenous peoples and their narratives.

          <div class = container></div>
<h2 class="story-title">Core values</h2>

The Archive is authentic, connected and enduring. These core values function as an ethical compass for the archive and its employees. Together, the core values are the yardstick by which the Archive will measure all its activities – existing and new. The core values keep each other in balance and harmony.

          <div class = container></div>
<h2 class="story-title">Vision</h2>

The vision is our ambition: our direction of travel, our point on the horizon. The current vision was revised after internal discussions, and now articulates our ambition more clearly.
Our main task is to display, research and expand the collection.

          <div class = container></div>

Our focus on indigenous cultures and their people makes us unique as an archive. We take the best possible care in our collection so that future generations can enjoy and learn from the narratives as much as we do, in a manner that suits their origins.

          <div class = container></div>

We see the metaphorical walls of our archive as porous: we are open and absorb what happens in the world. We are a meeting place for dialogue to take place. This is how we give meaning to our collection.

          <div class = container></div>

We feel the responsibility to establish pathways and push boundaries in our own indigenous way. This is how we continue to offer inspiration to our consumers and the wider public.
